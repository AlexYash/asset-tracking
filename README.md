# DAT221x Introduction to NoSQL Data Solutions Lab #2
This is a fixed code for Microsoft's edX course DAT221x Introduction to NoSQL Data Solutions (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-nosql-data-solutions-2) Lab #2 asset-tracking web app.

It works being deployed via MS Visual Studio 2019 Communinity Edition but doesn't work being deployed to an existing web app directly
using Deployment Center.

**documnetdb** branch is build as the original project on *.NET Framework 4.6.2* and **CosmosDB** is build *.NET Framework 4.7.2.*

Deployment guide:
1. Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio.
2. Publish it to your Azure web app or create a new one (Azure web app F1 free tier should be enough).
3. Open the web app via a link in an Owerview section.
